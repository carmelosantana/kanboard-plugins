# Changelog

All notable changes to the CalendarPlugin will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-05

### Changed
- Calendar assets (FullCalendar ~282KB + calendar.js/css) now load **only on
  calendar pages**, no longer on every Kanboard page (M1). Asset-hook
  registration is gated on the current route in `Plugin::initialize()`.
- The global calendar's assignee filter no longer exposes the entire user
  directory to non-admins — it now lists only users assignable on projects the
  viewer can access (M6). Admins still see all active users.

### Fixed
- Checkbox filter labels ("Hide completed", "Show unscheduled") now lay out
  horizontally — the modifier class was out-specified by the base label rule (M11).
- Removed the duplicate "today" button from the calendar's right toolbar (M13).
- Unscheduled sidebar now refreshes when the project filter changes (M10).
- The reschedule endpoint returns `400` for a missing/non-numeric `task_id`
  (malformed request) instead of `403` (M7).

### Internal
- Reschedule authorization moved to a unit-tested
  `CalendarQueryModel::canUserReschedule()` and covered for every project role,
  closing the controller-auth test gap the whole-branch review flagged (M8).
- `FullCalendar.Draggable` is registered once per sidebar instead of on every
  refresh (M9); guard against a missing events-feed URL (M5); simplified the
  admin project-scope query to an unqualified column (M4).

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- Global calendar page (`/calendar`) showing tasks across all accessible projects
- Per-project calendar page (`/project/:id/calendar`) scoped to a single project
- Per-project Calendar tab in the project view-switcher header
- Global Calendar link in the user dropdown navigation
- FullCalendar month grid view (`dayGridMonth`) with drag-and-drop to reschedule tasks
- FullCalendar agenda/list view (`listMonth`) toggled via toolbar button
- Unscheduled tasks sidebar — drag unscheduled tasks onto the calendar to set a due date
- Filter bar: filter events by project(s), assignee, category, and hide-completed toggle
- Per-project page auto-scopes events to that project (no manual project filter needed)
- Task popover on event click: shows project, column, assignee, and link to open task
- Overdue task highlighting (red border)
- Assignee avatar initials on each calendar event
- Project and time-estimate badges on each calendar event
- CSRF-protected drag-to-reschedule endpoint
- Admin users see all active projects; other users see only their accessible projects
